		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Hi! I am Leo, from Hong Kong.<br><br>
		2016 has been a fruitful year.<br>
		I have done tons of stuff that I have longed to do and discovered a lot more I wanted to pursuit.<br>
		Having plateaued in my previous job, I decided to step out of my comfort zone. And it was the best decision in my life.<br><br>

		I travelled to places that I did not even dare to dream of before -- the profile pic and the landing page photos were taken in Salar de Uyuni, in Bolivia, by me and my friends whom I met when travelling in Peru.<br><br>
		Making friends from different cultures, trying out different lifestyles and daring myself to conquer new challenges are surely unforgettable experience that I would treasure for the rest of my life.<br><br>
		Eventually, I travelled for six months in Europe and South America and ended up learning coding for four months in Silicon Valley.(Wait! What?)<br><br>

		One may wonder, why would it end up this way?<br>Nobody, including me, would have thought that would happen. And this brings us to my application of the summer cohort of Founders and Coders 2017.</p>

		<h2>The Trip</h2>
		<p>I started in Germany, then travelled to in Austria, Czech, Hungary, Greece, Denmark, Sweden, United Kingdom (I figured I could use more than four days), Spain, then to Peru, Bolivia; and at that time decided to pursuit a free coding school in Silicon Valley so I cut my trip short and returned to Hong Kong via Chile and Australia to make my US visa. And eventually spent four months in US.<br><br>
		So technically speaking I have travelled five continents except Africa and Antarctica. And took more flights than the rest of my life combined.<br> Create a lot of new personal records as well. First time in Europe, First time in America, first time using Couchsurfing (my first host taught me how to dumpster-dive), etc. and found out a lot about myself, like afraid of height(after biking down a 4000 meters high mountain).</p>

		<h2>42 in Silicon Valley</h2>
			<p>The free coding school in Silicon Valley is <a href="https://www.42.us.org/" target="_blank">42 USA</a>.<br>
			42 is a revolutionary school which offers free coding education, through peer to peer project based learning.<br>No teachers, no classes and no schedules, students, from all sorts of background, ranging from newbie to experienced developer, learn at their own pace and through their peers.<br>Before becoming a student, one must go through online exams and a gruelling, one-month-long coding exam -- The Piscine.<br><br>The Piscine, which means "Swimming Pool" in French, was a one-month-long exam in C and candidates were allowed to use only certain functions from the unix standard library to complete daily tasks.<br>That was the hardest and the most gruelling exam that I have ever taken as I had no programming background by then. I worked more than 90 hours a week to catch up in the exam and eventually got in as one of the top 10% of the batch. Around one third of the batch made it.<br>That was one of the most intense learning experience and the steepest learning curve I have ever had.<br><br>After entering the program, apart from coding the projects in the curriculum, which are mainly in C, I attended all kinds of talks, conference and joined hackathons; these really changed my perspectives about Tech, as the environment and atmosphere are completely different than those in Hong Kong.<br> The photo on the right is about my friends in 42 and I winning a hackathon. We built a smart home app using smell for event notification, using javascript to program the AI in Amazon Alexa and Google home. <br>And I am very satisfied about my progress, as I started from zero several months ago.<br><br>
			I loved the experience and embraced those changes. But unfortunately, due to VISA issues, I had to go back to Hong Kong and suspended my study.<br><br>
			But I still want to learn more in coding, especially in web development and javascript, then I found out about Founders and Coders...</p>

		<p>Founders and Coders, I hope.<br>And I really buy the idea of peer to peer project based learning as I tried and loved it when I was in 42. I believe it is the future.<br> I love intense and immersive learning methodology as well. And FAC has a good track record of getting its graduates in Tech, the curriculum is also focusing on the latest web technologies, which I need to brush up on.<br>Looking forward to join FAC and make a bang in Tech in London.<br><br>This is my first website, hope you have a good time reading it.</p>
